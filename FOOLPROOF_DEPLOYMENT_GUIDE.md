## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Repository is empty" in GitHub
**Solution:** Make sure you uploaded the files to the ROOT of the repository, not in a subfolder.

### Problem: Railway deployment fails
**Solution:** 
1. Check you set Root Directory to `backend`
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check Railway logs for specific errors

### Problem: Vercel build fails
**Solution:**
1. Check you set Root Directory to `frontend`  
2. Verify `VITE_API_URL` environment variable is set
3. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors

### Problem: Frontend loads but API calls fail
**Solution:**
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` points to your Railway backend URL
2. Make sure Railway backend is running (check Railway dashboard)
3. Check browser console for specific error messages

### Problem: Database connection fails
**Solution:**
1. Make sure PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is automatically set by Railway
3. Check Railway logs for database connection errors
